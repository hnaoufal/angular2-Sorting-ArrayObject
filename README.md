# Description

Shows how to use Sort and Pipes with Angular2.


### Installation & Build

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
You're ready to write your application.

Remember the npm scripts in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
* `npm run typings` - runs the typings tool.
* `npm run postinstall` - called by *npm* automatically *after* it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires.
